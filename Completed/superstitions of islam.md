### Superstitions in Islam

1. Jinns(Halal)

**Jinn** also romanized as **djinn** or anglicized as **genies** are invisible creatures in early religion in pre-Islamic Arabia and later in Islamic culture and beliefs. They say that Jinns may be believer or non-believer. Islam denies all affinities between the jinn and God, thus placing the jinn parallel to humans, also subject to God’s judgment and afterlife.
